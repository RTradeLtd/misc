# apc-ups

zabbix template to monitor APC UPS machines, graciously borrowed from https://github.com/samwiseg0/zabbix.

I found the link to this on zabbix share website, however as the github repository is not licensed, this is hesitantly included. I have opened an issue on the github https://github.com/samwiseg0/zabbix/issues/7 and if requested I will remove this.
